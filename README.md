# asv_demo
Demo for dynamically defining benchmarks from test suites for Air Speed Velocity

This project demonstrates that you can write your tests and only your tests in
normal pytest-discoverable format, or as unittest stuff, and you can do some
voodoo to get ASV to run benchmarks using those tests, rather than writing your
own benchmark-specific tests.
